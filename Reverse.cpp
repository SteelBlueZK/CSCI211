/*4. Write a program that will continuously ask the user for positive 
integers (until the user enters a negative integer at which the 
program will be terminated). Every time the user inputs a positive 
integer the program will print out this integer in reverse. Your 
program should have a function that accepts and integer and returns 
an integer in reverse. To convert the integer to its reverse, your 
program will call this function.
